# VendingMachineSales
The purpose of this project is to use the data to understand trends, patterns and revenue from other machines to determine where the next location of our new vending machine will be placed.
user behavior, user consumption habits, and overall preferences by consumers at different locations also play a factor.

After analysis we determined that the new location for the vending machine will be placed in a community center like a recreational faciltity, where not only children place but teens and adults. 
We chose this location due to the fact that majority of the sales were cash transactions and the locations most of those transactions occurred. This vending machine is being placed in a great up and coming locations where kids and families go to have fun and interact with one another. All snacks and drinks provded in this new machine were chosen due to the productions all 5 of the other machines most sold products.
